# Arukereso
My first Node.js JavaScript web application, which I created for one my courses at the University.

There are two tables in the backend: products, and stores. Users can search for products to see in which store and at what price can they purchase the specific product. There is a way to add new stores, and new products to chosen stores. Users can also modify existing stores and products as well.

The database (MongoDB) runs in a docker container, and when I finished implementing the functions I also containerized the whole application, which you can see and try for yourself [here](arukereso.liaffa.hu).
